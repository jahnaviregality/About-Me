## Projects I’ve Worked On

### Fully Functional AI Applications
- Healthcare cost prediction systems — robust feature engineering, transparent validation, light deployment pipeline.  
- AI-based recipe generators — constrained generation, nutritional estimation, and user personalization.  
- Automated portfolio builders — multi-source data ingestion and pragmatic allocation heuristics.  
- Gesture-controlled operating systems — multimodal input handling, latency-aware control loops.  
- Budget & expense tracking systems — privacy-aware summarization and lightweight analytics.  
- Productivity browser extensions — event-driven automation and compact local models.  


### Advanced NLP & Intelligent Systems
- Resume parsing, scoring & improvement systems — structured extraction and feedback generation.  
- Fake review detection & synthetic review generation — adversarial testing and robustness evaluation.  
- Sentiment & opinion mining frameworks — multi-granularity pipelines with benchmarked metrics.  
- Emotion recognition systems — multimodal fusion and calibrated classification.  
- Book genre classification engines — hierarchical and ensemble approaches for text classification.  
- RAG-based PDF question‑answering systems — ingestion, chunking, retrieval, and traceable answers.

### Research & Hackathon Work
- Smart India Hackathon — microplastics analysis: domain-specific pipeline and prototype delivery.  
- Student-led research prototypes and applied papers — structured guidance, reproducible experiments, and co-authored outputs.  



## Teaching, Research & Mentorship
- Curriculum ownership: designed and delivered NLP and Full‑Stack Development courses with laboratory components; lab setup completed in ≈81 days.  
- Real‑time mentoring: guided 200+ students through intensive project cycles (15–20 day timelines), emphasizing problem framing, model rationale, and deployment paths.  
- Research mentoring: advised student research with publication-focused rigor, reproducible evaluation, and experiment documentation.
